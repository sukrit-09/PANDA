## Model
We are developing a web application that leverages the CHATGPT API, integrating custom learning datasets to enhance its performance and achieve desired outcomes.
The initial phase of our application involves a login interface where individuals can input an anonymous name, protecting user privacy. Once logged in, users can engage in conversations with our chatbot.
Users will receive a Mental Health Score after their conversation. The chatbot will provide insightful warnings and suggestions based on its analysis of the interaction.
For premium users, they will have access to the advanced chatbot and it is able to detect potential signs of mental disorders. It generates a personalized health report, offering valuable insights based on its comprehensive findings.

## Used Technology:
Our conversation model relies on GPT language models, utilizing RAG analysis and Text embedding for deep-learning insights. The entire system is hosted on Azure AI Cloud for seamless and serverless processing of algorithms.
To prioritize user privacy, we've implemented an encryption layer within the application which ensures a secure and confidential experience for all users, safeguarding their information throughout their interactions with the chatbot.

## Benefits:
Our app ensures mental health support is accessible to all, overcoming barriers of time and location. Users can seek help anytime, anywhere, fostering a more inclusive and flexible approach to well-being.
We are trying to gamify the process of the user understanding their mental health and developing healthy habits to maintain proper mental wellness by leveraging the analytical capabilities of our chatbot to score users on their mental health and even detect potential issues and provide tailored insights catering to a diverse range of user needs

## Business Proposal:
Keeping with our goal of making mental health aid more accessible we plan to adopt a freemium model. Providing users with Basic functionalities of the chatbot for free. Unlimited access to all the advanced chatbot features will be given to our Premium users at a monthly price of $10. In the future, we want to collaborate with therapists to make remote personal therapy sessions with our users available through our app.
